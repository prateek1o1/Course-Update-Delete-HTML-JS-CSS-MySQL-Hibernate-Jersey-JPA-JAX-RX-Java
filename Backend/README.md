Backend
Service Folder/Package
It is the business logic tier of the backend. This is done so that the only thing thatâ€™s done by the
classes in the controller package is to receive the request from the frontend, send the request to
a service class, receive the response and send this response back to the frontend with the
appropriate status code.
